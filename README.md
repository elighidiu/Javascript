### DOM exercises
- I know how to create a table and add content to it. First I create the table elements (table->tbody->tr->td->textnode) then append each element to its parent in the oposite order (textnode->td->tr->tbody->table).
-  I have to look more into DOM input field manipulation. How to select all Input elements instead one at a time? Could not make it work with querySelectorAll (ex 09 match password two & optional)

### Section 11 - fetch

For the *fetch* exercises, you are going to need to query a REST API.
We have provided you with a small script to run this API locally.

Open a second terminal, then _navigate_ to the repo folder. Then issue the following commands :

    npm run api

From there, you will have a REST API available at `http://localhost:3000`
